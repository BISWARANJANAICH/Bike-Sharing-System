Bike Sharing System
Brief Description:

This repository contains the solution for a case study involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. 
The goal is to identify significant factors influencing bike rentals and understand how these variables impact demand dynamics. 
This model will enable the management of BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider, to strategize and optimize their operations in the post-pandemic scenario.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains daily bike rental data with features like weather conditions, seasonality, and user types (casual or registered). Key points include:

Target Variable: cnt (total bike rentals).
Important Features: yr (yearly trends), season, weathersit, and others.
Data Preprocessing: Features such as season and weathersit are converted to categorical strings for better interpretability.

## Purpose of Analysis:

BoomBikes has experienced a dip in revenues during the pandemic and aims to anticipate bike-sharing demand to create a competitive edge. 
By analyzing historical data, this project aims to:

1. Identify significant variables affecting bike demand.
2. Quantify the influence of these variables on overall demand.
3. Provide insights to guide business strategy and decision-making.
